<h1>Hello awesome students!</h1>
<p class="intro-paragraph">We know how to launch DevTools, what HTML is, and where we should write our HTML text. It's time for exercise. Let's create a very basic website that will contain heading, paragraph, link to an external website, image, and list of items. As we don't know CSS yet, don't worry about aesthetics for now. We're starting with exercise one folder, where we have an index HTML. Let's open the files in Atom. </p>
